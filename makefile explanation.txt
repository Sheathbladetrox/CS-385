CXX      = g++
CXX_FILE = $(wildcard *.cpp)
TARGET   = $(patsubst %.cpp,%,$(CXX_FILE))
CXXFLAGS = -g -std=c++11 -Wall -Werror -pedantic-errors -fmessage-length=0

all:
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CXX_FILE) -o $(TARGET)
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(TARGET).exe

-Wall, -Werror, -pedantic-errors are all ways to keep your code running while notifying you of errors within your code
	-Werror turns warnings into errors
	-Wall keeps code running while giving you warnings
	-pedantic-errors notifys you of more bugs and errors

-g allows for better optimization for running code, effectively cutting down time
	-Debugs code and traces code for errors
-std is the C++ standard
Wildcard searches for the directory of a file

Build instruction must come after a tab character (all:)
-f is a force command
Under "clean", rm removes a TARGET.exe file, and adding -f forces it to remove that file

echo <<input>> | ./<<filename>> > output.txt == Outputs into a text file

valgrind --leak-check=yes ./<<filename>>
